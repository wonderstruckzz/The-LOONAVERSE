### What is the Loonaverse?
Semi-popular k-pop band LOONA is the origin of the Loonaverse, a in music video lore storyline committed to over a 12 music video project to start with and a continuing storyline based off of this original plot. To introduce someone to the Loonaverse, first, you must introduce the 3 subunits - Loona 1/3, who's lore is based in our reality, Loona OEC, who lives in "Middle Earth", which is like Earth but more hallucinations, and YYXY, who lives in a mysterious place called Eden that everyone who lives there hates and wishes to escape. 

These 3 units come together to form a team who are forced to "save the world," or, I think. This is a really confusing subject. They live on a **mobius strip**, and all their adventures are held on this strip. 

#### LOONA 1/3

LOONA 1/3 consists of members Heejin, Hyunjin, Vivi, and Haseul, with honorary member Yeojin (she was too young to take part of the project initially.) These five had their albums released first, and are the set-up to what the Loonaverse is. All coming from different places on Earth (in lore, that is.), each member represents a different animal, place, fruit, and such. 

**HEEJIN - ViViD** 
 
 Heejin's Vivid marks the start of the Loonaverse, and makes her the creator of all of the Looonaverse. In story, she is a parallel to Olivia Hye, and the most important character for the beginning arc of the story, as she creates the world and basically disappears. This is like salutary neglect, like what the British did to the Americans. Her color is white, and she represents purity, as her animal is a bunny. In her music video, Heejin makes colors appear and life more ViViD.
 
 Personally, I would rate ViVid a solid 7.5/10, and 7th out of the 12 songs. 
 
 **HYUNJIN - Around You**
Hyunjin's Around You has a lot of cat heads. I cannot tell you what happens, honestly, but there's a lot of cats. She bonds with cats and gets a bracelet from a cat. She really likes cats. It's a cute cat, to be far. 

I rank this 11 out of 12. 

**HASEUL - Let Me In**
This is one of the best songs in existence. She shoots a bird, and somehow it turns into a feather. But it's so classy. The vibes are so nice. She canonically is the coolest person in the Loonaverse. 

This is a 2 out of 12. I'm sorry, Let Me In. 

**ViVi - Everyday I Love You**
The cutest song in this series. But it's also about amnesia and robots. It's like gundam but with real people, I think. It's not very clear. I honestly have no idea what happens but she works in a store and sells tapes so that's cute. 

This is a 12/12.

#### YEOJIN 

Yeojin, at the time of the LOONA project, was only 14, so she could not debut because of school. Therefore, she is not part of the aformentioned LOONA 1/3 or the next group called Odd Eye Circle (They literally have odd circles in their eyes.) Yeojin, however, still had a solo album, and was the 4th debuted member, but was unable to promote it like the other members. However, it may be the most iconic song on this list. 

**YEOJIN - KISS LATER**
 
 Yeojin's Kiss Later is funky. It's fresh. It's everything good about the world. It's rainbows and sunshine. There's a person with a frog head. It's glorious. It's amazing. It's the best song ever. 
 
 I rank this a 6/12.
